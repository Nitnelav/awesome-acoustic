Here we want to state the scope of what projects we believe should be included in this repository.

This is opened to discussion, if you think something should be changed, please open an issue.

## Free and open source

The project must be free and open source, ie. the source code must be publicly available, without the need to request access.
Preferably, the project should be licensed under a recognized open source license (e.g. MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.). However, we may accept projects without a license if the source code is publicly available though it is not recommended.

## Acoustics related

Drawing a clear line of what is considered in the field of acoustics and vibrations or not is close to impossible.

To start, let's say something like : Anything related to the science of sound and vibrations in solids, liquids, and gases, including their generation, transmission, and effects on various systems including animals and humans.

## Not music (except musical acoustics)

There are a lot of resources that exist for music processing, generation, analysis, etc.
There is an exception for musical acoustics, ie. the study of the physics of musical instruments, sound production, and perception of musical sounds.

## Not too old

We want to focus on actively maintained projects. Therefore, we will generally not list projects that have not been updated in the last 2 years.

## Very inclusive

We will list projects of any size, any programming language, any level of maturity, etc.
From small scripts to large frameworks, from experimental code to production-ready software, from niche tools to widely used libraries.

## About MATLAB

Yes, you have to pay to use MATLAB projects. Initially the idea was to reject MATLAB projects. However, many academic labs spend a lot of effort into creating, sharing and maintaining open source MATLAB code. So we believe they have their place in awesome-acoustic as well.
